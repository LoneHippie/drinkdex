# Drinkdex Front End

Drinkdex is a web app for sharing, saving, and uploading cocktail recipes. Features entries with detailed recipe info and instructions, image upload and an account system with secure authentication from a home made API.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Sass

### Project Goals

This was my first full stack (MERN) web application which presented many unique challenges for both the front and back end. The biggest challenges of building the front end was finding ways to achieve clean looking responsive layouts for both recipe entries and recipe upload forms, as well as handling complex multipart form data which included an image upload option. Another large challenge I had to overcome was figuring out how to deploy both the front end and back end. Overall I feel like this may have been one of the most instructive personal projects I've taken on and I managed to learn a lot about architecting a full stack project.
